New in this version
===================
28 March 2017

* added functionality for writing units for values to datafile
* added functionality for demo: creating data from ramdom function, without connection to plc. DEMO is shown in headline of aqserver
* added functionality for booloffset: boolean values within one byte are added an offset, so they can be shown in one plot without overlapping each other
* config values are now case sensitive. ATTENTION: config values IP, RACK and SLOT must be changed to lowercase in your old config files (ip, rack,slot). This was changed because the value names where all in lower case.
